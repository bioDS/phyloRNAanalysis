# Processed files

This branch contain additional processed files. These might be useful for replicating the analysis or for additional tree exploration/reconstruction.

* `fasta`: Fasta files made out of Expression and SNV data, filtered to a certain data density of a subset of sequences.
* `trees`: Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic trees, including a posterior sample of trees
* `tests`: Tests of phylogenetic clustering, precaculated MPD and MNTD statistics stored in R binary `.rds` files.

These files are tracked using the *Git Large Data Storage* (LFS) extension.
